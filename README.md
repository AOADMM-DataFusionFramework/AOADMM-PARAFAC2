This repository contains Matlab code for fitting constrained Parafac2 models with Alternating Optimization - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (AO-ADMM). The Algorithm is briefly described in the AO-ADMM for Parafac2.pdf file.
For an example on how to use the code, see script_test_AOADMM_PARAFAC2_nonnegativity.m
