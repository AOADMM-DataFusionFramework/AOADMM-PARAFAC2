This repository contains Matlab code for fitting constrained Parafac2 models with Alternating Optimization - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (AO-ADMM) proposed in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9615927 and https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/21M1450033. 
The Algorithm is also briefly described in the AO-ADMM for Parafac2.pdf file.
For an example on how to use the code, see script_test_AOADMM_PARAFAC2_nonnegativity.m
